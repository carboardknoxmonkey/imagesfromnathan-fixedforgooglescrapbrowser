            Back in the far off year of 2022 I had foot surgery. This was done to correct some problems that would've prevented me from walking by the time I was 50. So I went through this now in order to avoid harsher problems later.<br><br>
            After that was done I went through a process of physical therapy. Which was hard but was also worth it. In june I went on vacation with my family to California. We traveled up the california coast and my feet hurt like hell for most of it. But this here was fun. I took this image at some point there and I thought it was cool.<br><br>
            This hike allowed me to see what I specifically need to work on. and that was walking on sand. With how my feat were I could barely walk on sand. If I walked bare feet I tripped and fell over and over untill I gave up and put on sandles. But then my shoes fill with sand, and I still trip and fall. Infact I was moving slower than without them. This process would repeat at every sandy place we stopped at. Sneakers didn't work well for this either. But hiking boots, when they were good and snug, allowed me to walk normally. Anyway, after awhile I managed to get better walking on sand.
