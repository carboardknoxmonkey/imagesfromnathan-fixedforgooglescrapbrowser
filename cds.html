            I collect CDs. I have been doing so since 2019. I do this mostly because I don’t trust streaming to keep every song I like.<br><br>
            The First CD I ever got was Quebec by Ween. For a few months it was completely missing from all streaming. Now at the time I really liked this album (I still do!) and I wanted to listen to it. So I got the CD off of Amazon. Fast forward and now I have over forty. Chump change compared to some I’ve seen.<br><br>
            Soon after that I got Pioneers who got scalped: The Anthology. This was a compilation of DEVO songs from their first official releases with their own Booji Boy Records to some of their last releases through Enigma Records. <br><br>
            Now I’m not going to write something about every CD I own. That would be, not only insane, but also a complete waste of time for both of us. Here are just a few interesting things. <br><br>
            Quite a bit of these from looking at them just seem like Cardboard Sleaves. Sadly Some of them are that way. Both Pink Floyd discs, Ok Computer OKNOTOK, Flying Microtonal Banana, and Quarters are packaged in Carboard Sleaves. This would be fine with me, however the disc is not in anything else. It’s just in the sleeve. Duck Stab and The Commercial Album by the residents are certainly in a nicer sleeve but they’re in one that I’ve seen other artist’s use. But they did something different. They put the discs in sleeves so that you don’t smudge the disc or rip the case while trying to remove it. Now most are in something called a Jewel Case. These are the hard plastic cases. You see. Some are in cardboard but are in something called a Digipak. Mezmerize and Nonagon Infinity are in these types of case. However I’ve seen them out in the wild. I suspect they’re going to become more popular for disc storage soon rather than Jewl Cases. Due to their lower cost and that they take up a fewer amount of space than the standard CD cases. <br><br>
            Weird Al’s album Straight Outta Lynwood is not a normal CD. For starters it’s in a super jewel case. Which is like the regular clear jewel cases, but with more security for the disc. Sort of like those DVD cases which have security locks on them super jewels have a latch that holds the case shut. Its also supposedly stronger. Looking inside the case you’d see the disc has no art except around the hole. This Disc has a CD on one side and a DVD on the other.  The DVD side contains bonus features like a making of the album, music videos for the album, as well as enhanced DVD quality audio playback for the whole album.<br><br><br><br>
