            While on that road trip with my family we went up into Oregon. I have some things to say about Oregon. But it was a beutiful country.<br><br>
            It seems that every town you passed through had a Pot Shop of some kind. I'm pretty sure that one town's weed store was just ran out of the back of a van.<br><br> We went up to portland.<br><br> It sucked.
            On the way back I drove for quite some time.<br><br>
            The rest of this trip involved going through Navada to see my Uncle and then going back through Vagas.
